## Animatoon


**Animatoon** is a 2D painting program (and later, I hope to add animation), for windows, and Later for MacOS and Linux (I'm looking for users of Purebasic who would like to compile for this platform). This software lets you create traditionnal hand-drawn painting, using bitmap, and vector graphics (in a next version). Animatoon is free and open-source (licence GPLv3).

Animatoon is developped in [Purebasic][1] and has been created by Blendman (Since 2011, 2012-2015, 2017, 2021), with the help of a lot of people :) (Purebasic forums french, english and german) [Purebasic User Forum (english)][2]
